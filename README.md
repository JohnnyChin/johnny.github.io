## Welcome to My Portfolio

This page is about myself, my hobbies etc. Credits to **@codeforasia** and **@frae91** (Telegram) for helping me set up this page!
The Navbar is created thanks to Frae's input!

#### Overview
  
A brief description of myself


#### Attributes/Features
  
Lists of my hobbies, attributes, and skillsets. 

When I was creating this section, I wanted to show my personal progress in the 'skillset' section. Drwaing inspiration from what my friend Adil did, I made use of the Bootstrap utility 'progress' to achieve this.


#### Gallery
  
Articles that are really interesting, so I thought why not share them on my page?


#### Gallery
  
A sneak peek into my personal projects, my favourite sites, etc.

I tried to achieve a PHP-Google Sheet link with the form-submit function, but unfortunately Github only supports static pages, and not other server-side functionalities. Nevertheless, for aesthetic purposes, I keep the form-input layout and provide a link to a Google Form in another page to collate submission data.
